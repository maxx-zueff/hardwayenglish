# HardwayEnglish

Type. Wait. Repeat.

## Description

The project is a collection of English grammar rules. At the beginning of learning only one collection with rules is allowed (Present Simple, for example). In order to unlock more collections, you should make an effort, be patient and go through some hardcore grammar exercises.

At least 3 students are required to start learning the collection. The maximum number of students is five. After the recruitment process of three students, the timer starts, and within 5 minutes more participants are expected to join the learning process.

The basic idea is re-typing sentences in accordance with English grammar rules. It will take a hell of a time but will pay off later with the learning process. Every rule has few examples of the construction of the following rule. You should type this example to pass to the next rule. The more accurately the examples will be repeated, higher will be your score.

When you complete each rule in the collection you should pass the test based on what you have learnt. After completing test you'll be able to get a new collection (but you should go through the test without a single mistake, it is gonna be pretty hardcore). If you, unfortunately, make any mistake, you will be taken back to the beginning of the test (Oops!).

And after five days of passing a collection, you will need to pass the exam. At this point, every opened collection gets locked and you must type examples from you old collections you have passed five days ago! Upon the completion, it opens the locked collections.

## Conclusion

I can't see any easy way of learning English (and any language to be honest). You should repeat rules without forgetting what you have learnt previously, and that can be achieved only through annoying hard work and patience. I want to help you and others, who has hard times learning English.
